              strategic positioning.</p>
          </header>
          <div class="image main"><img src="/assets/images/ola0.png" alt="" /></div>
          <p> <br>By performing this analysis, stakeholders can identify areas for improvement, forecast future
            performance, and make data-driven decisions to enhance Ola's competitive edge and profitability.</p>
          <h3> SQl Queries For Analysis</h3>
          <h5>Retrieve all successful bookings:</h5>
          <p>To determine the number of successful bookings, we can use this straightforward query for analysis.
           </p>
        
           <pre style="background-color: lightgrey; color: black; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">
            <code>
CREATE VIEW Successful_Booking AS
SELECT *
FROM bookings
WHERE booking_status = "Success";
            </code>
          </pre>
          
          <h5>List the top 5 customers who successfully booked the highest number of rides:</h5>
          <p>The purpose of identifying the top 5 customers who successfully booked the highest number of rides is
            to recognize your most frequent and loyal users. This insight can help tailor marketing strategies,
            offer personalized rewards, and improve customer retention by focusing on high-value customers.</p>
          <pre
          style="background-color: lightgrey; color: black; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">
  <code>SELECT Customer_ID, COUNT(booking_ID) AS 
  Highest_Number_Of_Rides
  FROM bookings
  WHERE booking_status = "Success"
  GROUP BY Customer_ID
  ORDER BY Highest_Number_Of_Rides DESC
  LIMIT 5;
  </code></pre>
  
          <h5>Retrieve all rides where payment was made using UPI</h5>
          <p>The purpose of this query is to analyze bookings made using UPI as the payment method. By filtering
            data in this way, businesses can gain insights into the usage patterns and popularity of UPI among
            customers.</p>
          <pre
          style="background-color: lightgrey; color: black; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">
  <code>SELECT *
  FROM bookings
  WHERE Payment_Method = "UPI";
  </code></pre>

          <p>
          <h3> Insights For Vehicle's Performance</h3>
          The below visualization displays booking data for various vehicle types on the Ola app, including total
          booking value, successful booking value, average distance traveled, and total distance traveled. It
          shows that Prime SUV has the highest booking value, followed by Prime Plus and E-Bike. Most vehicles
          have an average distance traveled of approximately 25 km, with Prime Sedan having the highest total
          distance traveled.
          </p>
          <div class="image fit"><img src="/assets/images/ola3.png" alt="" /></div>
          <h3> Insights For Cancelled Rides</h3>
          <p>The graph illustrates cancellation rates for rides on the OLA ride-hailing platform, broken down by
            cancellation reasons. The most frequent reason, making up 29.36% of cancellations, is "More than
            permitted people in there." The second most common reason, "Driver asked to cancel," accounts for
            25.43% of cancellations. This data indicates that the company should focus on enhancing the driver
            onboarding process to ensure drivers are well-informed about the terms of service and properly
            trained. Additionally, improving communication with customers regarding ride restrictions, such as
            the number of passengers allowed, may help reduce cancellations.
